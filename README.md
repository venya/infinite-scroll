## HTML & CSS coding

1. Create a html & css layout;
2. Add responsiveness layout when you resize the browser window:
  * Indentation along the edges of the blocks must be not less than 100 px.
  * Blocks have floating width 190 - 300 (px).
  * Background image should be to lay the entire area of the document.
  * With decrease of the window, the third block has to jump in the second row and stretch the width of the first row.
  * With a further decrease, blocks should be one under the other.

## JavaScript coding

3. Add the "Load more" button (design and layout in its sole discretion). 
Take data from items.json (it is possible to change the path to images and content at will).
  * By adding, new blocks should be added directly under the previous.

4. Add a switch "Enable infinite scrolling" (design and layout in its sole discretion).
  * After switching on of that mode - blocks must be loaded on the mouse scroll and the "Load" button should be disabled (or should not be visible on the screen).
  * When you turn off the mode - nothing happens with mouse scroll and must return to the "Load more" functionality.
